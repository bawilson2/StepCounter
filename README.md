# StepCounter

Basic Step Counter application for Android.  It is able to be held in any orientation but works best when it is held secure to the user's upper body, either with an edge touching the torso or held with arms tight to the user's sides. The further away from the body it is held, it is less accurate and seems to miss steps due to the arms dampening accelerometer results.
